# WordScramble

Inspired by Paul Hudson at [HackingWithSwift.com](https://www.hackingwithswift.com), this started as a project that was part of his [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).  From there I reworked the UI to suit my pesonal taste, expanded the assets, and added features until it was the app I thought it could be.

My code and assets are public as a learning resource.  Please feel free to copy from here, making sure to give credit to Paul and myself if any of this is used publicly.
